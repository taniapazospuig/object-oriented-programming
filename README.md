## Object-Oriented Programming - Universitat Pompeu Fabra

This repository contains my group deliverables for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course, a second-year subject in the Bachelor's degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. The deliverables in this repository correspond to the **2023 edition** of the course. 

### Project Details

This repository contains the lab deliverables developed with my partner **Aniol Petit**. The labs were primarily conducted in **Java**, with an introduction to **C++** in the final lab. Each lab builds on the previous design seminars, focusing on implementing various aspects of a football application, including class structures, inheritance, sorting mechanisms, and the Comparable interface. Each lab also includes a report documenting our approach and code implementation.
